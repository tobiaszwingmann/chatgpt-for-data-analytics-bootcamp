# Data

This course is based on a modified version of the [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) dataset.  

To better reflect real-world scenarios, the original data has been **enriched with custom product descriptions** and **expanded customer attributes**.  
Additionally, the dataset has been restructured into a **relational database**, capturing richer relationships between entities.  

The schema and table connections are illustrated below:
